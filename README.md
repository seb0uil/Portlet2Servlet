# Portlet2Servlet
Portlet2Servlet is a jsr168 compliant webapp you can use to render several portlets.
It aims to be used as a portal maker.
Roadmap include :

 - Manage users, groups and right management
 - Ability to create structure/template and article, so manage content.
 - Write back office for that
 - some few others stuff

In the same time, I'll try to upgrade to jsr286.
